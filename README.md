Untextured and textured raycaster

Both raycasters aim at simulating a 3D environment using a 2D map. This project was made to learn how does raycasting work and how to implement a simple version.<br>
It was made by following Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorial originally written in c++, translated and adapted by myself in python.<br>
The tutorial is available by following this link: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html#Untextured_Raycaster_<br>
Pygame was used to make the raycaster playable.<br>
Textures where also found while reading the tutorial they all come from the game Wolfenstein 3D.<br>

Install and Run:<br>
Make sure to install every package in the requirements.txt file or to activate the env (source env/.venv/bin/activate for linux and MAC OS).<br>
You may run the untextured raycaster by calling: python3 main.py<br>
Or: python3 main.py untextured<br>
You may run the textured raycaster by calling: python3 main.py textured<br>

How to play:<br>
Use the arrows from your keyboard to move.<br>
You cannot look up or down, this raycaster aim to imitate Wolfenstein 3D.<br>
Press escape to quit.<br>

This project is not aimed at a commercial use, and you are free to download and modify it at your will.
