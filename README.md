Untextured and textured raycaster

Both raycasters aim at simulating a 3D environment using a 2D map. This project was made to learn how does raycasting work and how to implement a simple version.
It was made by following Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorial originally written in c++, translated and adapted by myself in python.
The tutorial is available by following this link: https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html#Untextured_Raycaster_
Pygame was used to make the raycaster playable.
Textures where also found while reading the tutorial they all come from the game Wolfenstein 3D.

Install and Run:
Make sure to install every package in the requirements.txt file.
You may run the untextured raycaster by calling: python3 main.py
Or: python3 main.py untextured
You may run the textured raycaster by calling: python3 main.py textured

How to play:
Use the arrows from your keyboard to move.

Press escape to quit.

This project is not aimed at commercial use, and you are free to download and modify it at your will.
